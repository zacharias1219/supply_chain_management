# AI-Enhanced Supply Chain Optimization Tool

## Project Overview

The AI-Enhanced Supply Chain Optimization Tool is a comprehensive SaaS solution designed to optimize supply chain operations, predict demand, and manage inventory efficiently. Leveraging AI-driven modules, this platform helps businesses streamline their operations, reduce costs, and ensure timely delivery of goods.

## Features

1. **Demand Forecasting**: Uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical sales data, market trends, and external factors to predict future demand accurately.
2. **Inventory Management**: Provides real-time insights into inventory levels, automates replenishment processes, and optimizes stock levels to avoid overstocking or stockouts.
3. **Supplier Management**: Evaluates supplier performance, predicts potential disruptions, and suggests alternative suppliers to ensure a resilient supply chain.
4. **Route Optimization**: Uses AI to determine the most efficient delivery routes, reducing transportation costs and delivery times.
5. **Cost Optimization**: Analyzes various cost factors and provides recommendations to minimize overall supply chain costs.
6. **Risk Management**: Identifies potential risks in the supply chain and provides mitigation strategies.
7. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Offers a dashboard with real-time monitoring of supply chain activities, providing insights and alerts for any deviations from the plan.
8. **Sustainability Tracking**: Monitors the environmental impact of supply chain activities and suggests sustainable practices to reduce carbon footprint.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API
